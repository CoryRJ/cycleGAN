# cycleGAN
My implementation of cycleGAN, included are some helper files.
I made the most simplistic update variables possible as I dont have that many variables. The first function in cycleGAN_plain.py describes what each line is.

Using cycleGAN for Male <-> Female conversion.
The celebA dataset.
Key:
Rows 1 and 4: Original Images
Rows 2 and 4: Cycle consistency F->M->F and M->F->M
Rows 3 and 6: Domain transfer F->M and M->F

This particular project has been shelved for something else that I am currently working on.
